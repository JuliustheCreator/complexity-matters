# Complexity Matters
## Introduction
This project explores the topic of algorithm complexity and its impact on runtime. I created line graphs using Matplotlib and NumPy libraries to plot the runtime of several hypothetical algorithms for problem sizes ranging from 1 to 10<sup>4</sup> and 1 to 10<sup>2</sup> respectively.

These graphs can be found in Complexity Matters Notebook.ipynb. This notebook contains the full code used to complete the tasks, including the algorithm implementations and the code for creating the line charts.

## Credits
This project was created by Julius Broomfield for CSc 2510.
